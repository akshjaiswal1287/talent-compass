Bias-aware privacy-first recruitment & candidate screening layer on Midnight

## Initial Product Idea

TalentCompass addresses critical privacy requirements in Web3 applications by leveraging Midnight's zero-knowledge selective disclosure framework. The system allows users and institutions to prove compliance, eligibility, and state transitions without exposing sensitive underlying records or private inputs to the public blockchain.

## Privacy Model (Public State vs. Private Witness)

* **Public State (On-Chain Anchor)**:
  * Contract state commitments, Merkle roots, and update counters stored immutably on Midnight Preprod.
  * Zero-knowledge proof verification tokens enabling anyone to independently verify valid operations.
* **Private Witness (Off-Chain Data)**:
  * Full medical details, identity attributes, financial amounts, and internal policy rules remain local on the user's client device.
  * Nullifiers and commitments ensure single-use proof integrity without revealing user identity or payload data.

## Verified Contract Deployment

* **Network**: Midnight Preprod Testnet
* **Contract Address**: `0x02b581c19d45e77192a83e0123ef4599a81c`
* **Live Demo Link**: [https://talent-compass.vercel.app](https://talent-compass.vercel.app)
